Welcome to ForexToGo. 
This is my first real coding project and fullstack app. It utilizes Expo, React, Python and Flask. This app tracks ForexFactory.com's main page and scrapes for the main information day traders view each day. My goal is to take that information and condense it into a space thats glanceable and intuitive like a widget, the app's main function. Inside the app you can see all the same info that would be displayed on the widget but you'll be able to make modifications to the widget, filtering out the currencies you dont want in the settings tab.

ALL DATA DISPLAYED BELONGS TO FOREXFACTORY.COM.
