React elements work similar to javascript. However two cannot just be set side by side without being wrapped in a fragment or else errors will occur.

fragment: <></>

proper way:
<>
  <element></element>
  <element></element>
</>

error:

<element></element>
<element></element>

you can make custom components like <Text> yourself in react. They must start with a capital letter.

above "export default function app()" you can define a component by doing

function CustomComponent() {
	return <element id="id">content</element>
}

OR:

const NewComponent = () => {
  return <Text>this is my content</Text>
}

Then all you need to do to recreate it is call CustomComponent like

<div>
   <CustomComponent/>
<div>

if you want to be able to pass a value you can use a custom property similar to how is used "id" to do so. 
You can also use this to create properties that call variables or functions.

*Property names are arbitrary
Property: string
Property2: calls a function

function CustomComponent()...  --> function CustomComponent({ property, property2 })...

function CustomComponent({property, property2}) {
  return <button property={"hello-world"} property2={clickEvent}>{property}</button>
}
...
<CustomComponent/>
output: button that says hello world
change {property} within the button element to {property2} to get the output of whatever function.


If you want it to have functionality when clicked we can add more to the function. We can define a function within our component and using HTML's basic
element properties we can call that function. We'll be using "onClick" inside of our button element to call the function

function CustomComponent({property}) {
  function WhenClicked(){
	console.log("button clicked")
 }
  return <button onClick={WhenClicked}>{property}</button>
}
